# Lynda AWK Essential Training



## 01. Introduction

We'll need to have some experience with the command line and have an AWK installed. I'll be using mawk:

```{bash}
mawk -W v
```


### Exercise files

All of the exercise files for this course are in `exercise files`.




## 02. What Is AWK


### Naming

It's named for Alfred *A*ho, Peter *W*einberger, and Brian *K*ernighan. If you search for Brian Kernighan, you'll find some videos with him talking about AWK (at least in part), such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg4U4r_AgJU. 


### Where it's found

In general, it's probably already installed on macOS and linux distros.

```{bash}
awk -version
```


There's also, nAWK, gAWK, mAWK, and others.


### What's it good for

Mostly for text processing and data operations.
