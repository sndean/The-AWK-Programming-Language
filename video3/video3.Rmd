# Command line basics

## First awk program 

```{bash}
mawk '{print $2, $1}' ../exercise_files/names.txt
```


```{bash}
mawk '{print $1, $1}' ../exercise_files/names.txt
```


## Records, fields, etc.

In that first Awk program fields are columns, which are called by the `$` with a number for the first (`$1`) or second (`$2`) columns. 

Records are rows.

As another example. Here we'll pull the second field out of a file:

```{bash}
mawk '{print $2}' ../exercise_files/dukeofyork.txt
```


line contains "up"

```{bash}
mawk '/up/{print NF, $0}' ../exercise_files/dukeofyork.txt
```



line has six words

```{bash}
mawk 'NF==6{print NF, $0}' ../exercise_files/dukeofyork.txt
```
