# AWK

## 1.1 Getting started

Here's a list of employees, pay rate, and hours worked

```{bash}
cat emp.data
```


Calculating pay for people who worked > 0 hours

```{bash}
mawk '$3 > 0 {print $1, $2*$3}' emp.data
```

The people who didn't work

```{bash}
mawk '$3 == 0 {print $1}' emp.data
```


As you may be able to see from the above two examples, most of the awk programs we'll be writing have a certain set up: `pattern {action}`, where we have a pattern that we match (e.g., the 3rd field is `0`) and then an action based on those rows that match the pattern.



## 1.2 Simple output

In the first code chunk, I wrote `cat emp.data`. The awk equivalent is

```{bash}
mawk '{print}' emp.data
```

`print $0` will also print the whole line


```{bash}
mawk '{print $0}' emp.data
```

Now without the pay rate

```{bash}
mawk '{print $1, $3}' emp.data
```

Note that comma between field 1 and 3 is semirequired. See the output without the comma.
