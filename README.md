# The-AWK-Programming-Language


This is a repository for notes, code, and other things resulting from going through [The AWK Programming Language](https://ia802309.us.archive.org/25/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf). I was inspired to read through this book because of several HN posts, including [this relating to the book](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17140934) and [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17322412). Also, this blog post [Don’t MAWK AWK – the fastest and most elegant big data munging language!](http://brenocon.com/blog/2009/09/dont-mawk-awk-the-fastest-and-most-elegant-big-data-munging-language/) and related [github repo](https://github.com/brendano/awkspeed). Overall, while I knew/know and used Awk quite a bit before for various scripts, it seems like a good time to learn Awk more formally. And although these notes, code, and other items in this repo are almost entirely meant for my consumption only, I hope -- if you're wanting to learn Awk -- they're also useful for you.
